# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## FIX ERROR
I've found a solution you need to go to:

node_modules/expo-blur/android/build.gradle

and then, inside this file you will see

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.Dimezis:BlurView:version-2.0.3'
}
in my code was in this version, do o just change to:

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.Dimezis:BlurView:version-2.0.6'
}
And then I run

npx expo prebuild and after npx expo run:android and it worked for me, let me know if it will work for you
